        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Napoleon Bonaparte was born on August 15, 1769, in Ajaccio, Corsica.
          His family had modest origins, but he quickly rose through the ranks
          due to his intellect and military prowess.
        </p>

        <h2>Military Genius</h2>
        <p>
          Napoleon's military career began during the French Revolution. He
          rapidly climbed the ranks, gaining recognition for his victories in
          Italy and Egypt. In 1799, he staged a coup d'Ã©tat, establishing
          himself as First Consul.
        </p>

        <h2>Emperor of the French</h2>
        <p>
          In 1804, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French. His military
          campaigns, including the famous Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, expanded
          the French Empire across Europe.
        </p>

        <h2>Napoleonic Code</h2>
        <p>
          As a reformer, Napoleon introduced the Napoleonic Code in 1804, a
          comprehensive legal system that influenced modern legal frameworks
          globally.
        </p>

        <h2>Downfall and Exile</h2>
        <p>
          Napoleon's ambitious expansion led to conflicts with other European
          powers. Defeated in 1814, he abdicated and was exiled to the island of
          Elba. He briefly returned during the Hundred Days in 1815 but suffered
          a final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo.
        </p>

        <h2>Saint Helena</h2>
        <p>
          After his defeat, Napoleon was exiled to the remote island of Saint
          Helena in the South Atlantic, where he spent the last six years of his
          life.
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Napoleon Bonaparte's legacy is mixed. He is remembered as a military
          genius, a skilled administrator, and a promoter of the Napoleonic
          Code. However, his aggressive expansionism and quest for power also
          brought widespread conflict and suffering.
        </p>

        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
          Napoleon Bonaparte died on May 5, 1821, on Saint Helena. The exact
          cause of his death remains debated, with theories ranging from stomach
          cancer to arsenic poisoning.
